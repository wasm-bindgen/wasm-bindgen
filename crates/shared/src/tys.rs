/// Special opcode used in the `__wasm_bindgen_descriptors` custom section to
/// indicate that the next `u32` in the schema stream is not a literal but a
/// reference to a symbol whose linker-assigned value (typically a function
/// table index) must be resolved by `wasm-bindgen-cli-support` after linking.
///
/// Stream encoding when this opcode appears:
///
/// ```text
/// SYMBOL_REF (u32)
/// name_len   (u32)        // length in bytes of the UTF-8 symbol name
/// name_bytes ([u8; n], padded to 4-byte alignment with zeros)
/// ```
///
/// On decode, `cli-support` looks up `name_bytes` in the wasm module's
/// exports (and name section as a fallback) to find the function it refers
/// to, resolves it to a function-table index, and substitutes that index
/// into the stream as the next `u32`. The remainder of the stream is then
/// interpreted unchanged by `Descriptor::decode`.
///
/// The macro only ever emits `SYMBOL_REF` in one position: the `shim_idx`
/// slot of a `FUNCTION` node. Because this value (`0xFF`) can also occur as
/// *literal data* elsewhere in the stream — e.g. the codepoint `U+00FF`
/// (`'ÿ'`) inside a name, or an `ENUM`/`STRING_ENUM` count of 255 — the
/// `cli-support` resolver (`descriptors_section::resolve_symbols`) is
/// **structure-aware**: it walks the same grammar as `Descriptor::decode`
/// and only interprets `SYMBOL_REF` at that `shim_idx` slot, copying every
/// other word (opcodes and literal data alike) through untouched. The
/// specific numeric value is therefore not load-bearing for disambiguation;
/// `0xFF` simply sits clear of the dense opcode range (currently `0..=36`).
pub const SYMBOL_REF: u32 = 0xFF;

/// Structural tags for the reference-based `Schema` tree (see
/// `wasm_bindgen::describe::Schema`). These label the *shape* of a `Schema`
/// node and are shared by the producer (runtime composition) and the consumer
/// (`wasm-bindgen-cli-support`, which walks the tree out of a cast record's
/// data segment). They are a separate namespace from the schema *opcodes*
/// above: tags live in the `Schema::tag` field, never in the flat opcode
/// stream that `Descriptor::decode` consumes.
///
/// Flattening is uniform regardless of tag — a node contributes its `words`
/// run followed by the flattened streams of its `children`, in order — so the
/// tags are primarily documentation/validation aids:
///
/// * `Leaf` — `words` only, no children (e.g. `i32`, `JsValue`).
/// * `Wrap` — leading `words` plus one or more children (e.g.
///   `Option<T>`, `&T`, the closure trait-object header + arg/ret schemas).
/// * `Cat` — no `words`, children only (pure concatenation). Reserved: no
///   runtime impl or macro path currently emits a `Cat` node, but the
///   flattening rule and the CLI walker handle it like any other node (an
///   empty `words` run followed by the children), so it is safe to start
///   using. It is exercised by the `Schema` unit tests.
///
/// `#[repr(u32)]` pins the discriminants so the `Schema::tag` field keeps the
/// exact 4-byte layout the previous bare-`u32` constants produced; the
/// CLI-side `#[repr(C)] Schema` parser is unaffected.
