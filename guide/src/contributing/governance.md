## Code of Conduct

We abide by the [Rust Code of Conduct][conduct] and ask that you do as well,
with the moderation role performed by the [core team].

## Membership

We welcome new collaborators in the project! The project is not owned by any
specific entity or group and belongs to the community as a whole.

If you make two or three significant contributions, you should seriously consider
requesting collaborator membership.

If you are a collaborator and notice that someone has made two or three significant
contributions to it, you should also seriously consider nominating them for collaborator
status!

**To request to join as a Collaborator, post a [collaborator request issue] stating
your intent to join the project, and it will be reviewed by other members.**

### Core Team

The core team is responsible for project governance and moderation, operating
based on a majority vote.

The project as a whole seeks to operate on consensus, such that core votes are
typically only needed in the event of governance changes and process escalations.

Core team members are themselves selected by a core team vote, and are required
to maintain active participation as core members. Active participation is currently
defined as regular attendance at monthly core meetings.

## Changes Policy

When merging code changes, the following PR policy applies:

* We operate on a full consensus contribution model based on always assuming good faith.

* All collaborators, including core team members, have equal contribution rights.

* All pull requests must be reviewed and approved of by at least one other collaborator, and ensuring adequate time for reviews before merging.

* All explicit requests for changes on PRs by other collaborators must be resolved prior to merging.

* In case of disagreements, and as a last resort when all other consensus-building methods have been exhausted, escalation to a core team vote
may be initiated for the next core team meeting.
