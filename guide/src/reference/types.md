# Supported Rust Types and their JavaScript Representations

This section provides an overview of all the types that `wasm-bindgen` can send
and receive across the WebAssembly ABI boundary, and how they translate into
JavaScript.

Many core JavaScript types support [generic type parameters](./types/generics.md) using type erasure, allowing you to work with typed collections like `Array<T>`, `Promise<T>`, `Map<K, V>`, and more.
