# Catching Panics

By default, when a Rust function exported to JavaScript panics, Rust will abort
and any allocated resources will be leaked. If you build with with
`-Cpanic=unwind` and the `std` feature, Rust panics will be caught at the
JavaScript boundary and converted into JavaScript exceptions, allowing proper
cleanup and error handling.

When enabled, panics in exported Rust functions are caught and thrown as
`PanicError` exceptions in JavaScript. For async functions, the returned promise
is rejected with the `PanicError`.

## Requirements

- **`panic=unwind`** - The panic strategy must be set to `unwind` (not `abort`)
- **`-Zbuild-std`** - Required to rebuild the standard library with the `unwind`
  panic strategy
- **Rust nightly compiler** - `-Zbuild-std` is only available on nightly
- **`std` feature** - `std` support is required to use
  `std::panic::catch_unwind`. to catch panics.

## Building

Build your project with the required flags:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-Cpanic=unwind" cargo +nightly build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -Zbuild-std=std,panic_unwind
```

Or set these in `.cargo/config.toml`:

```toml
[unstable]
build-std = ["std", "panic_unwind"]

[build]
target = "wasm32-unknown-unknown"
rustflags = ["-C", "panic=unwind"]

[profile.release]
panic = "unwind"
```

Then build with:

```bash
cargo +nightly build
```

## How It Works

### Synchronous Functions

When a synchronous exported function panics, the panic is caught and a
`PanicError` is thrown to JavaScript:

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn divide(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    if b == 0 {
        panic!("division by zero");
    }
    a / b
}
```

```javascript
import { divide } from './my_wasm_module.js';

try {
    divide(10, 0);
} catch (e) {
    console.log(e.name);    // "PanicError"
    console.log(e.message); // "division by zero"
}
```

### Async Functions

For async functions, panics cause the returned promise to be rejected with a
`PanicError`:

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub async fn fetch_data(url: String) -> Result<JsValue, JsValue> {
    if url.is_empty() {
        panic!("URL cannot be empty");
    }
    // ... fetch implementation
    Ok(JsValue::NULL)
}
```

```javascript
import { fetch_data } from './my_wasm_module.js';

try {
    await fetch_data("");
} catch (e) {
    console.log(e.name);    // "PanicError"
    console.log(e.message); // "URL cannot be empty"
}
```

## Closures

Rust closures passed to JavaScript with `Closure::new`, `Closure::wrap`, and
`Closure::once` also catch panics when built with `panic=unwind`. When a panic
occurs inside a closure invoked from JavaScript, the panic is caught and thrown
as a `PanicError` exception.

Like exported functions, catching panics in closures requires the closure to
satisfy the `UnwindSafe` trait.

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
extern "C" {
    fn setCallback(f: &Closure<dyn FnMut()>);
}

let closure = Closure::new(|| {
    panic!("closure panicked!");
});
setCallback(&closure);
```

```javascript
try {
    triggerCallback();
} catch (e) {
    console.log(e.name);    // "PanicError"
    console.log(e.message); // "closure panicked!"
}
```

For closures that should not catch panics (and abort the program instead), use
the `*_aborting` variants: `new_aborting`, `wrap_aborting`, and `once_aborting`. These do
not require `UnwindSafe`.

See [Passing Rust Closures to JavaScript](./passing-rust-closures-to-js.md) for
more details on closure panic handling and the `UnwindSafe` requirement.

## The PanicError Class

When a panic occurs, a `PanicError` JavaScript exception is created with:

- `name` property set to `"PanicError"`
- `message` property containing the panic message (if the panic was created with
  a string message)

If the panic payload is not a `String` or `&str` (e.g., `panic_any(42)`), the message will
be `"No panic message available"`.

## Limitations

### Nightly Only

This feature requires a nightly Rust compiler and will not work on stable Rust.

### UnwindSafe Requirement

All function arguments must satisfy Rust's `UnwindSafe` trait. This is
automatically handled by wrapping arguments in `AssertUnwindSafe`, but be aware
that this assumes your code handles potential inconsistent state after a panic.

### Mutable Slice Arguments

Functions with `&mut [T]` slice arguments cannot be used because mutable slices
are not `UnwindSafe`. Consider using owned types like `Vec<T>` instead.
